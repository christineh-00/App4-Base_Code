Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is for the user to determine if they are experiencing sprain or strain through a series of questions.
 
Known Issues:
The symptoms of the two are similar, this website will display the final results at the end after all questions have been answered.
Ignore this error message if you see it using the javaScript console: Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'.
